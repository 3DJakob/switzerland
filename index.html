      <h1>COUNTRY & TOWN</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          Switzerland is a country situated in Central Europe adjacent to
          France, Germany, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. The capital city is
          Bern even though Zürich is bigger. It has a population of over 8
          million people and the official languages are German, French, Italian
          and Romansh. Having so many official languages strongly effects the
          country as many people speak different languages depending on the
          region and situation. Therefore it is mandatory to learn two of the
          official languages in school as well as English.
        </p>
        <p>
          The country is divided into 26 cantons with Bern as seat of the
          federal authorities. Together the cantons make up an area of 41,285
          km2 with a max north to south distance of 220km.

          I was placed in the town of Rheinfelden just beside the German border
          defined by the river Rhine and not far from France. Rheinfelden is a
          small town with 11 596 inhabitants. The town mostly consist of big
          apartment buildings and tightly placed houses. The area serves mostly
          as a residential area and it seems as though most people transit from
          there every morning.

          From Rheinfelden there is a 1 hour train ride to Zurich which also
          stops in places like Baden and Brugg. My daily commute consisted of a
          buss ride to the train station followed by a 30 minutes train ride to
          Brugg where a finally switch to a train going to my workplace in Birr.
          It becomes very apparent that the train infrastructure is very well
          developed and you can basically go anywhere by train. The trains are
          always very punctual which is crucial for this type of structure.

          This report will help to give insight into the professional aspects of
          Switzerland as well as the cultural. I will take a closer look of
          the education system and through Libs as well as a lean evaluation to
          discover ways the company can improve.

          Choosing my destination for my journey was not an easy decision. The
          environment and nature has always been very important so I knew I
          wanted to go to a country with beautiful scenery. Me and another
          friend set our goal for Iceland but as it turned out it was hard to
          get a internship there. As time passed I needed to open up to other
          possibilities and I came across Switzerland. A snowy, hilly country
          famous for chocolate. I had found my destination.
