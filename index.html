      <h1>COUNTRY & TOWN</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          Switzerland is a country situated in Central Europe adjacent to
          France, Germany, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. The capital city is
          Bern even though Zürich is bigger. It has a population of over 8
          million people and the official languages are German, French, Italian
          and Romansh. Having so many official languages strongly effects the
          country as many people speak different languages depending on the
          region and situation. Therefore it is mandatory to learn two of the
          official languages in school as well as English.
        </p>
        <p>
          The country is divided into 26 cantons with Bern as seat of the
          federal authorities. Together the cantons make up an area of 41,285
          km2 with a max north to south distance of 220km.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was placed in the town of Rheinfelden just beside the German border
          defined by the river Rhine and not far from France. Rheinfelden is a
          small town with 11 596 inhabitants. The town mostly consist of big
          apartment buildings and tightly placed houses. The area serves mostly
          as a residential area and it seems as though most people transit from
          there every morning.

        <p>
          From Rheinfelden there is a 1 hour train ride to Zurich which also
          stops in places like Baden and Brugg. My daily commute consisted of a
          buss ride to the train station followed by a 30 minutes train ride to
          Brugg where I finally switched to a train going to my workplace in Birr.
          It becomes very apparent that the train infrastructure is very well
          developed and you can basically go anywhere by train. The trains are
          always very punctual which is crucial for this type of structure.

      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          This report will help to give insight into the professional aspects of
          Switzerland as well as the cultural. I will take a closer look of
          the education system and through Libs as well as a lean evaluation to
          discover ways the company can improve.

        <p>
          Choosing my destination for my journey was not an easy decision. The
          environment and nature has always been very important so I knew I
          wanted to go to a country with beautiful scenery. Me and another
          friend set our goal for Iceland but as it turned out it was hard to
          get a internship there. As time passed I needed to open up to other
          possibilities and I came across Switzerland. A snowy, hilly country
          famous for chocolate. I had found my destination.

      <h1>WORK</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <h3>Company</h3>
        <p>
          I worked at the company libs Industrielle Berufslehren Schweiz which
          is a school focused on practical studies for future work applications.
          Their vision is to help students to be professional learners and to
          utilise each students full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing thats very different from here in Sweden is the fact that
          the students or apprentices as they are called go in school for 2 days
          and then work 3 days with their respective profession. That gives the
          students a unique work experience compared to other schools and gives
          them a way to ease in to the full work life that will eventually
          follow.
        </p>
        <h3>Working hours</h3>
        <p>
          At Libs the students have longer days than back in Sweden. The day
          starts at 7 am and ends at 4 pm. Beyond that they also have shorter
          breaks adding up to a total of only 55 minutes. That results in 8
          hours and 5 minutes of work per day compared to Swedens measly 6 hours
          and 20 minutes. This greatly increases the amount of things the
          students have time to learn and is required to be able to set aside 3
          days for work.
        </p>
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>
          I had my internship at the electrical department of Libs where the
          students learn about relays, plcs, pneumatics, components, building
          circuits and so on. Each student gets his/her own workbench with a
          load out of useful tools like wrenches, screwdrivers and pliers. The
          students then retrieves the material needed for their project.
          Everyone works in their own tempo and it was not uncommon to see five
          people each quietly at their bench working at completely different
          things.
        </p>
        <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>
          The students are guided by mentors who give out and supervise the
          tasks at hand. They evaluate the students work and verbal
          presentations of the task is quite common. What's key here is that the
          mentors tailors a work plan for every specific student after their
          individual needs. During the whole education programme there are a few
          selected categories with assignments that every student have to
          finish. This can however be done in any order. That way student can
          have way more authority over what they work with at the moment
          compared to Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that the teachers have the title mentors is also reflected in
          the way they work. You learn by doing and the mentors are more like a
          guide helping you get back on the right track rather than teaching you
          straight away.
        </p>
        <h3>Gender equality</h3>
        <p>
          At the workplace in Birr where I was situated there were no girls
          taking the automation technician class. This however is not due to any
          gender rules but rather a lack of interest among girls.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is something that’s changed faster in Sweden. Mechanical subjects
          and engineering as a work is way more popular among females in Sweden
          although males have the majority. This is in both countries mostly
          because of the remains of older times where women weren’t considered
          capable of working that domain.
        </p>
        <h3>Career possibilities</h3>
        <p>
          The education plan at Libs stretches across 4 years the 2 first being
          work at school and then the 2 last an internship at a company like
          ABB, Siemens, General Electrics and so on. After the 4 years the
          students are guaranteed a job in their area of expertise.
        </p>

      <h1>LEAN</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          Lean is a way of working with a company’s effectivity by visualising
          and eliminating waste. During my stay I  made some observations both
          good and bad.
        </p>
        <div class="argument">
          <i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          <p>
            Brakes are very punctual and students honor the schedule.
            Immediately when the brake starts everyone just drops everything and
            walks to the breakroom and once it’s over everyone storms out exactly
            in time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="argument">
          <i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          <p>
            The students work really intense during work hours and mostly
            do not slack off or chat with co-workers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="argument">
          <i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          <p>
            Breaks during the day are very short which increases the time
            available. The only downside by this is that the students might find
            it hard to relax during breaks as well as focus during the workshops.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="argument">
          <i class="fa fa-minus-circle minus" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          <p>
            A really long time is spent on cleaning which does not produce
            any products. Keeping the workplace organised is very important in lean
            but because the long time available for cleaning people work in a very
            slow pace. This could be solved by adding schedules for the different
            areas that needs to be cleaned to make everyone responsible for a
            specific task.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="argument">
          <i class="fa fa-minus-circle minus" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          <p>
            There are a lot of tasks with very repetitive work which does
            not teach the student anything more but just takes time. To get the
            right balance is hard though since people learn in different phases.
            This problem is partially solved by the fact that the mentors choose
            which assignment the person in question should do to learn as fast as
            possible. However many of the assignment in themselves could use some
            refinement. One of the first tasks I got to complete was making a
            simple serial and parallel circuit using high gauge wires and crimp
            terminals. The circuit diagram was filled with unnecessary cable
            connections to teach you more about crimping but it would have been
            better to have more assignments stepping up the circuit design and
            function while teaching you more about crimping.

      <h1>CROSS CULTURAL ASPECTS</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          One of the most interesting cultural differences between Sweden and
          Switzerland quickly turned out to 	simply be the lack of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Switzerland seems to share a lot of the things I always regarded as
          typical Swedish like avoiding sitting 	next to another person on the
          buss or train, keeping distance on the platform while waiting and the
          level of 	politeness and lack of words when meeting stranger at places
          like the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
          One big difference however is how accepted smoking is. In Sweden
          smoking is disregarded by many and 	for those who smoke they have a
          responsibility to move away from others. In Switzerland smoking is
          very common and it was not uncommon to see somebody taking a smoke at
          the seat next to you on the station causing a need to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Punctuality when it comes to schedules is also way more important in
          Switzerland as stated above with the breaks. In Sweden it’s normal to
          stop and talk to your friends if you pass them in the hall or maybe
          sit a minute or two extra in the break room to finish a discussion.

      <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>
          These 3 weeks has been an experience like none other. I have gotten
          the privilege to stay with a Swiss family experiencing the Swiss way of
          living. Even though it was a pain to wake up at 6 in the morning just to
          commute for one and a half hour I will still miss it. The scenery was
          pretty incredible and it almost made up for the lack of WiFi on the
          train.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my stay I got to visit Mt Rigi, Zurich Zoo, Europa Park, Laser
          Tag and many many more. Iv’e visited 3 new countries being
          Switzerland, France and Germany and all of this is something that will
          stay with me for the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <p class="ending">
          Finally I want to thank my kind host family in Switzerland and I wish them the best!
